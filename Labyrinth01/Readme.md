# Hi This is Danny

## I am suprised that you are reading these words!!

Basically, this is a project what you can use to create some randomized "Labyrinths" (Kinda like the image below)

For a copy of this, you can click the "Code" Button (The Green One), and select "Download ZIP" in the "Local" tab (feels weird, kinda like the first time I use this website.)

And, you know what, this project takes me less than 1 week to make up -- it is not hard to start coding, and a reason I like coding is that we have a large, friendly community of the people who do code(Coders or Programmers), and when you are starting, don't worry, you can always ask your question in the communities -- Github([Here](https://github.com/)), Stack Overflow([Here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions)) and so many other social media based coding groups!

I hope you can be interested in coding(I know it's hard to form a hobby with just several words, but I hope.)
