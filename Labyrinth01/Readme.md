# Hi This is Danny

## I am suprised that you are reading these words!!

Basically, this is a project what you can use to create some randomized "Labyrinths" (Kinda like the image below)

For a copy of this, you can click the "Code" Button (The Green One), and select "Download ZIP" in the "Local" tab (feels weird, kinda like the first time I use this website.)

After you download the project, you unzip it, and run the "maze_maker_ui.py" (Make sure you have a Python Environment on your computer, for our school laptops, go Mosyle Manager ( This thing<img width="263" height="242" alt="Screenshot 2025-10-28 at 8 40 50 AM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f2c2564c-c1e6-4f9c-8014-8e089ece10d8" />) ), and in "My Apps", find "Python"(This thing<img width="1120" height="747" alt="Screenshot 2025-10-28 at 8 43 23 AM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e555803c-67cc-478d-87d4-6896052e41c2" />), click install (It may takes several minutes to install), and after installing, you should be able to play with the project. (Btw, **DO NOT SEPERATE THE 3 FILES! ALWAYS PUT THEM TOGETHER IN ONE SAME FOLDER!!**)

Btw, you know what, this project takes me less than 1 week to make up -- it is not hard to start coding, and a reason I like coding is that we have a large, friendly community of the people who do code(Coders or Programmers), and when you are starting, don't worry, you can always ask your question in the communities -- Github([Here](https://github.com/)), Stack Overflow([Here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions)) and so many other social media based coding groups!

I hope you can be interested in coding(I know it's hard to form a hobby with just several words, but I hope.)
